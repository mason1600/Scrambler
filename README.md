# REMEMBER YOU CAN UNSCRAMBLE YOUR TEXT DOCUMENT BY SIMPLY COPYING AND PASTING YOUR SCRAMBLED TEXT BACK INTO THE SCRAMBLER A SECOND TIME TO GET THE UNSCRAMBLED TEXT BACK NO MORE THAN ONE LINE AT A TIME TO BE SAFE PLEASE
# IF THE SCRAMBLER IS ACTING STRANGE AND ONLY GIVING YOU ONE WORD ITS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BECAUSE YOU COPYED A NEW LINE CHARECTOR OR CARRIAGE RETURN CHARECTOR ALSO KNOWN AS THE "ENTER KEY" USED IN LINUX TO END A COMMAND
# SO JUST MAKE SURE WHEN YOU COPY YOUR TEXT BACK INTO THE SCRAMBLER YOU DONT HAVE A BUNCH OF EMPTY SPACE IN THE TEXT DOCUMENT CREATED BY PRESSING THE ENTER KEY OR IT WILL STOP AFTER THE FIRST ENTER KEY SPACE IT SEES CREATING MADNESS
# The set -e command is used to make the program exit upon error just in case to many words are given to the scrambler usally no more than a line to be safe or it does weird things
# YOUR SCRAMBLED TEXT WILL BE FOUND IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE SCRIPT IT SELF IF RUN FROM THAT DIRECTORY CALLED scrambledsecret.txt
# OPTIONAL TO zip compress and encrypt and prompt to create keyphrase and create secret encrypted zip of scrambled text REMOVE THE COMMENT '#' SYMBOL FROM BEGINNING OF "LINE 13" '#' OR ADD IT TO NULLIFY AS A COMMENT
